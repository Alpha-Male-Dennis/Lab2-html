followed the lab procedures  to create a well structured html and using https://validator.w3.org/ to check for errors and found 5 errors, i had to make the necessary changes and still got the error saying heading should be from h1 to h6 and i made further changes with sections and div until i changed <section></section> to <div></div> and the error was gone
